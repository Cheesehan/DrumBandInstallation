# DrumBandInstallation
an interactive drum band installation, made possible with Max Cycling 74 and proximity sensor
This Drumband was called "the innerworld", which is my midterm project of the Interactive Installation class.
I have always been obsessed with the sound effects and how important sound is, as an essential element in our daily life, sound exists everywhere, especially in our innerworld.
We cannot see the faces of ourselves, the expression on our face, however, the sound inside our heart could be heard easily.
But with the high pace of urban life, people gradually ignore their own heart and own sound. That is also why I want to make this installation to help people to hear about the sound, deep down their hearts.
